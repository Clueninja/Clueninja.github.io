            <h2>
                Combat Robots
            </h2>
            <p>
                While I was a member of Sheffield Roboteers Society I developed 3 robots, 2 are society robots and one is my personal robot.
                
                All of these robots I printed from my Ender 3 S1 using eSUN PLA ST and designed in FreeCAD. The prints come out very well and I just need to sand and drill the parts a bit to get the perfect fit for 
                the bearings, screws etc.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Drum & Bass
            </h3>
            <p>
                Drum & Bass is my first spinner, it is a drum/ eggbeater design with a solid plastic weapon. It sports 2 wheel drive which means I get spend more weight on the weapon.
                
                This is my personal robot and has currently competed in no competitions but during testing performed very effective against brittle chassis.
                
                I used 2 n20 brushless motors, a malenki nano, and a 2202 Brushless Motor.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Sir Forkalot
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sir Forkalot is a flipper style robot, the flipper is directly attached to the servo, this reduces the weight of the mechanism but is not as effective as spring or band based 
                flippers, it is also 2 wheel drive.
                As a society robot it cannot compete in fights against spinners. In the few fights it has fought in it handles quite aggressively, however with a decent driver it can prove quite effective
                at flipping opponents.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Depth Charge
            </h3>
            <p>
                Depth Charge is a pusher robot, it has 8 forks around its body which makes it difficult to control from the sides, it also has 4 wheel drive, increasing the control the robot has against its
                opponents.
                
                As it is also society robot it also cannot be entered into fights with spinners but it has performed relativly well against Sir forkalot as the long forks make it difficult for the large fork
                on Sir Forkalot to get underneath and flip it.
            </p>

                ESP32 Bluetooth Low Energy Gamepad
            </h2>
            <p>
                My first personal electronics project. I designed and developed the software using the esp32-idf crates for Rust.
                You can see the project code and my write up  <a href="https://github.com/clueninja/esp32-ble-gamepad" title="Gamepad"> here</a>

                Simple Asteriods Game: <a href="https://clueninja.github.io/asteriods" title="Asteriods Game"> link </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                I made this game with my <a href="https://github.com/Matt-Jam" title="Friends Github">friend</a> to learn <a href="https://rust-lang.org" title="Rust Homepage">Rust</a>, the <a href="https://bevyengine.org" title="Bevy Homepage">bevy</a> game engine and how ECS based game engines work.
                We found it a lot of fun to make and is still work in progress, it is best experienced with a mouse and keyboard.

                Osmosis Simulation <a href="https://clueninja.github.io/Osmosis" title="NEA">website</a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is a website I made as part of my Computer Science non-examined Assessment.
                
                You can vary the concentration of water and salt molecules on either side of the semi permeable membrane and see the affect on the 
                speed of the particles and the movement of particles from one side of the membrane to the other.
                
                Osmosis is defined as the movement of water from an area of high concentration to an area olow concentration across a semi-permeable membrane.
                Osmosis can clearly be seen in both the macro and micro models.
                
                This website is best navigated with a mouse and keyboard.

            <h2>FXCG Projects</h2>
            <p>
                Using the fxcg sdk I developed a few applications for my Casio Fx Graphical Calculator.
            </p>
            <h3> Control </h3>
            <p>
                Control is an Application to display the step resposes and bode plots for first order and second order laplace transforms.
                
                The most challenging part of this applications is to find accurate algorithms for the different operations on doubles as there is no pow() or exp() function builtin.
                
                This project is mainly designed around my course, which invloves a lot of control theory and modelling.
            </p>
            <h3>Mandelbrot</h3>
            <p>
                The Mandelbrot Set is a fractal pattern, you can pan and zoom the camera and the beauty found in mathematics.
                
                I heavily optimised this application for performance, using fixed point calculations rather than doubles. However, this means you can't zoom in infinetely.
